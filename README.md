# Bollywood-Game-using-Java
I have created Bollywood game using java language. There  can be some problem its not completed right now. But I have tried all the possible outcome I can and corrected it, If you find some problem then please let me know.

"guessmovie.java" has all the logic and i have just added some of the movie names in "movie2.txt" file and imported that file in "guessmovie.java" and just pick up the random movie from "movie2.txt".
